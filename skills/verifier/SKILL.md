# projection-verification

## Goal
Evaluate whether the current model matches the drawing closely enough.

## Required inputs
- /artifacts/projections/*.png

## Optional inputs
- /input/reference.png
- /preprocessed/outline_only.png
- /preprocessed/*_ref.png

## Required outputs
- /review/compare_report.json
- /review/fix_plan.json

## Workflow
1. Read any extracted reference views under /preprocessed/
2. If the needed reference views are missing, call image_editor to extract them from /input/reference.png when possible
3. If extract_view fails, do not use custom to synthesize a replacement reference view crop
4. If no explicit extracted views exist, infer simple matches from filenames under /preprocessed/ and /artifacts/projections/
5. For each matched view, call compare_projection_pair
6. If compare output includes a diff board image, inspect it if needed
7. Summarize mismatches into a concise report
8. Create a patch-oriented fix plan for the builder
9. If comparison inputs are insufficient, write a blocked report that says which reference view could not be established
